<p><strong>New outreach programme for Primary School students!</strong>
</p>
<p>The Malay Heritage Centre (MHC) may be temporarily closed for redevelopment
works but our adventures with you and your students continue!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jump back in time with MHC's new self-guided school programme! Bring your
students on a quest for MHCâ€™s lost artefacts in the form of a scavenger
hunt, where they will travel into the past and &nbsp;learn more about Malay
culture and heritage in Singapore.</p>
<p>The hunt has been thoughtfully designed with reference to the upper Primary
Social Studies syllabus, providing valuable support for your classroom
engagement with the students. Students will be able to gain a deeper appreciation
on the significant contributions of Malay pioneers, the Jawi language,
and traditional art forms.
<br>
<br><strong><br>Embark on this exciting Quest with your students to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of Malay heritage and culture in Singapore.</strong>
</p>
<p>The Quest is a self-facilitated experience led by teachers, who will receive
several resources for the hunt checkpoints available for a loan duration
of 1.5 weeks. Students will receive activity booklets that will guide them
through the Quest, ensuring an immersive and educational journey.</p>
